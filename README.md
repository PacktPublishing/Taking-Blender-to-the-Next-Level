If you're ready to start exploring the more advanced workflows and processes in Blender to create intricate 3D models, then Taking Blender to the Next Level is for you.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Use geometry nodes to quickly create complex 3D scenes and motion graphics renders
* Create realistic textures using physically based rendering materials
* Understand how to model, rig, and animate your own 3D characters
* Use rigid body simulations to create dynamic scenes
* Understand how to perform 3D tracking within Blender

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the assets and project files are organized into folders. 

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This Blender 3D book is for 3D modelers, texture artists, character and technical animators, matchmove artists, compositors, and anyone interested in learning advanced concepts in Blender. Motion graphics artists will also benefit from this book. A solid understanding of 3D concepts and the Blender UI is needed to grasp the concepts present in this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-14).

### Software and Hardware List

| Chapter  | Software required                   | OS required                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------| -----------------------------------|
| 1-14     | Blender 2.93.x                      | Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Any) |
| 1-14     | Meshroom 2021                       | Windows, and Linux                 |

All the projects in this book have been created and built on Blender 2.93.x. The projects should work perfectly fine with Blender 3.x versions too. There may obviously be slight changes going forward as they develop Blender 3, but most of the changes they usually do are minor and should not break any workflows. However, the Geometry nodes chapters will work strictly on versions 2.93.x, since these nodes are updated with every version change. Version 2.93 has Long Term Support (LTS) till 2023 and you can download it from here: https://www.blender.org/download/lts/2-93/
